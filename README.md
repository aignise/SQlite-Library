# Python SQLite Library

## Introduction
This library provides a simplified interface for interacting with SQLite databases using Python. It abstracts away the complexity of direct SQL commands while allowing for easy and quick database operations.

## Features
- Easy-to-use functions for managing SQLite connections.
- Functions for executing insert, update, delete, and select queries.
- Utility functions for common database operations.
- Migration system for managing database schema changes.
- Examples and unit tests included.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation
Clone this repository or download the library files directly into your project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-sqlite-library.git
```

## Usage
Here's how you can use the various functions in the library:

### Creating a Database Connection
```python
from sqlite_library import get_connection
connection = get_connection('my_database.db')
```

### Creating Tables
```python
from sqlite_library.migration import apply_migration, create_users_table
apply_migration(connection, create_users_table)
```

### Inserting Data
```python
from sqlite_library.query import insert_data
user_data = {'username': 'johndoe', 'password': 'securepassword', 'email': 'johndoe@example.com'}
insert_data(connection, 'users', user_data)
```

### Updating Data
```python
from sqlite_library.query import update_data
updates = {'password': 'newpassword'}
conditions = {'username': 'johndoe'}
update_data(connection, 'users', updates, conditions)
```

### Deleting Data
```python
from sqlite_library.query import delete_data
delete_data(connection, 'users', conditions)
```

### Fetching Data
```python
from sqlite_library.query import fetch_data
rows = fetch_data(connection, 'users')
for row in rows:
    print(row)
```
